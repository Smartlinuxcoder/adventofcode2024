# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Welcome to my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024)! ðŸŽ„âœ¨  
All challenges are solved using the **Rust programming language** ðŸ¦€.

## How to Benchmark

You can benchmark the performance of my solutions using **Hyperfine**:

1. Build the project in release mode:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. Run the benchmarks:
   ```bash
   hyperfine --warmup 5 --shell=none ./target/release/adventofcode2024
   ```

Enjoy and happy coding!
